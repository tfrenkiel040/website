        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>This is my personal website. Here I will share insights into my work as a Marketer and SEO Specialist, along with regular updates from my blog.</p><br>
<p>As you can see, blog is written with a small b. I decided to go with the small b after reading the post <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/" target="_blank">Small b blogging</a> by Tom Critchlow. His work and many of what he has written, inspired me to launch this personal website.</p>
