        <p>Hello. This is my personal website. </p>
        <p>I developed this website in the summer of 2024, using Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Tachyons CSS with the help of ChatGPT. Making this website without any CMS was a great learning experience. </p>
<p>As you can see, blog is written with a small b. I decided to go with the small b after reading the post <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/" target="_blank">Small b blogging</a> by Tom Critchlow. His work and many of what he has written, inspired me to launch this personal website.</p>
<p>This website will be a work in progress, and blog posts will be iregular.</p>
