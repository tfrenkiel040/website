        <p>Hi, I'm Thomas and this is my personal website. </p>
        <p>I built this site in the summer of 2024 using Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Tachyons CSS. I had some help from ChatGPT along the way. Building it without a CMS turned out to be a great learning experience. </p>
<p>I think of my blog as a place to explore ideas and document projects. It's not about reaching a large audience, but about writing, creating something I can reference, and hopefully connecting with others.</p>
<p>This website will be a work in progress, and blog posts will be irregular.</p>
