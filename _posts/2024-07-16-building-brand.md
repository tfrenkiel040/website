Take the screengrabbed slide for example. It shows that while search ads may drive short-term gains, they don't contribute to long-lasting brand building.For brand, multi-sensory advertising works better.

This means leveraging sound, visuals, and motion to create a more memorable and impactful experience.

The graph also shows that this doesn't mean brands need to run TV ads per se. With creativity and good targeting, online video and display advertising can also make a long lasting impact on your audience. If you're interested in advertising, I really recommend you to watch this talk and the other 2 that were part of the same webinar. It is called ['The 3rd Age of Effectiveness'.](
