Coming back to my [previous post about this topic](https://thomasfrenkiel.com/marketing/2024/12/23/demand-gen.html).

There are two ways to understand 'demand gen'.
The first one is to see demand gen as a way to increase demand for the product cateogory. This is the economists way to look at the term. 

The other one is demand gen as a way to increase demand for a specific brand. While this makes sense (for marketing), I believe there are far better terms to describe the concept (for example, simply calling it branding or brand building).

**Demand gen as product demand generation**


In macroeconomics, demand means the following:
> Demand: all of the quantities of a good or service that buyers would be willing and able to buy at all possible prices; demand is represented graphically as the entire demand curve. (Source: [Khan Academy Macroeconimics course](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"})

It's important to understand that demand is always visualized as a curve, meaning that the demand at each pricepoint is taken into account.

From the course:
> In a competitive market, demand for and supply of a good or service determine the equilibrium price.
>  
> The law of demand
> Markets have two agents: buyers and sellers. Demand represents the buyers in a market. Demand is a description of all quantities of a good or service that a buyer would be willing to purchase at all prices.
> According to the law of demand, this relationship is always negative: the response to an increase in price is a decrease in the quantity demanded.


Now, let's take an example: Peugeot running ads for their newest Peugeot 2008. 
Question: will this increase demand for cars? 
No. If it's effective, it will *drive more existing demand* (people who want to buy a car) to Peugeot. 

So, Peugeot is not trying to increase demand for cars. They are trying to build memory structures so people prefer a Peugeot over other car brands.

What would increase demand for cars, is if Sweden, for example, would make it a lot easier to get a drivers license. This is an example of a change in regulation that influences demand.

For some reason, marketers in the software space they can influence demand by doing marketing activities, such as creating and distributing content, holding webinars, and organizing events. 

**Demand gen as brand demand generation**

I asked someone who says they're specialized in demand generation what it actually means. He said:

> Broadly speaking, demand generation is a marketing strategy that includes any activity that drives awareness and interest in your product or service.



If that's the case, I'd argue that we just call it brand marketing, branding, or top of funnel marketing, instead of abusing the existing term 'demand' in this way.
