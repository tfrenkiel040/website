I vibecoded a playable Pacman game! For those unfamiliar with the term, vibecoding is using AI to code. Ideally, you don't even type, but you just use speech to text to write prompts, and the AI creates does all the coding for you. With tools like Cursor, Loveable, and Replit gaining traction, this way to build stuff is becoming increasingly popular. 


I made the first version during a Funnel marketing department hackathon, then worked more on it in the evening hours, and put it on my personal website. Give [the game a try](https://thomasfrenkiel.com/pacman/) and let me know what you think!
