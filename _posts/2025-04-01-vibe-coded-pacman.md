I vibecoded a playable Pacman game! For those unfamiliar with the term, vibecoding is using AI to code. Ideally, you don't even type, but you just use speech to text to write prompts, and the AI does all the coding for you. With tools like Cursor, Loveable, and Replit gaining traction, this way to build stuff is becoming increasingly popular. 

I made the first version during a Funnel marketing department hackathon, then worked more on it in the evening hours, and managed to push it to my personal website. Give [the game a try](https://thomasfrenkiel.com/pacman/) and let me know what you think! 
(For now, Funnel Pacman can only be played on desktop, not on mobile.)

PS. It's awesome that Funnel encourages all employees to explore how AI can enhance our work and gives us both the tools and time to develop these skills. Itâ€™s great to be part of a company that sees the value in developing these skills.
