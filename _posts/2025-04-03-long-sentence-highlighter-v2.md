I'm excited to announce the release of **Long Sentence Highlighter 2.0** for Chrome! This major update brings significant improvements to my popular readability extension that helps writers and content creators identify overly long sentences in their work.

Originally created in April 2023, the Long Sentence Highlighter has been completely revamped with:

- A redesigned, more intuitive user interface
- Improved sentence detection algorithm that better handles complex punctuation
- Customizable highlight colors to suit your preferences
- Better compatibility with dynamic websites and modern web apps
- Reduced CPU and memory usage for improved performance

If you're not familiar with it, the Long Sentence Highlighter is a simple but powerful tool that automatically highlights sentences exceeding your specified word count on any webpage. It's particularly useful for:

- Writers looking to improve readability
- Editors reviewing content
- Content creators optimizing for reader engagement
- Anyone who wants to create more digestible content

The extension is designed with privacy in mind - it runs entirely in your browser without collecting or transmitting any data.

I'm always looking for feedback, so if you give it a try, I'd love to hear your thoughts on LinkedIn.
