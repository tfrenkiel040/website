In 2023 ChatGPT was relatively new. And people started experimenting with using ChatGPT to help them code. 

I don't exactly remember who inspired me to do this, but I started with creating a Google Chrome extension. I simply asked ChatGPT how to make one and used Sublime Text to create the files needed.

The extension I created was a very simple tool that on a webpage highlights all the sentences with too many words. Where 'too many' is defined by the user.

I think this is useful for people who work in corporate communications where the workers might not be super literate, for example a large employer like McDonald's might have a lot of young people working there and some of them may not have the literacy to read super long sentences. 

More importantly, is when governments need to communicate something, be it the municipality or the tax office or another government body. The information they share is crucial and they need to make sure that it can be read and understood by as many people as possible.

And research shows that longer sentences are a lot harder to comprehend than short sentences.

So with this Chrome extension a communications manager or web editor can go to their own website and check if they have very long sentences on important pages. And if they do, they can then try to edit the content making it easier to read.

So this was two years ago and I sort of forgot about making this until one of my colleagues, Bruno, mentioned it to me when we were talking about AI in the office.

And I realised that this tool that I made in 2023, which was not good at all to be honest needed to be improved. The original version had onr major flaw - it would never give the right word count for sentences that contained links to other pages. The HTML link tags would confuse the word counting algorithm, making the tool unreliable for many real-world websites. And I also knew that with Cursor AI, this would be easier than ever to fix.

So today in the morning I found the files that I used in 2023 opened a new project in Cursor, worked for maybe an hour and maybe 10 prompts. And then I was able to upload a major improved version to the chrome web Store. 

I still have some ideas to further improve this chrome extension, but I am happy that I was able to improve it today while taking care of my five month old daughter (everything was basically done during her naps. 

If you wanna try it, you can add the long sentence highlighter to Google Chrome [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fgklfjfnajfdfiefdphepgejkgmlplcc). (As of today, April 3 2025, I am still waiting for the 2.0 version to be accepted into the Chrome web store. So now you will still find the original version there.)
