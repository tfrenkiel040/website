In the summer of 2024, I used ChatGPT to build my personal website—the one that hosts these very blog posts. At the time, I used ChatGPT as my coding assistant. I would write some code (or copy snippets from the web), test them, and if things broke (which they often did), I'd hand it all over to ChatGPT and ask it to fix the mess. It worked. Well enough, at least, so I went live with the site.

I started adding some blog posts, but there were still things I wanted to improve on the site itself as well. Things that, in my mind, were just a little too complicated to wrestle with. I wanted to fix them, but I thought I would need to have a day of uninterrupted focus time to do it. But with a newborn in the house, I didn't have that time, of course. So I kept it as it was. 

Then, on Wednesday, February 26, 2025, I listened to [Marketing Against The Grain](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1OHMLhJ3hMkug2n3gJ694a){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, Hubspot's podcast, where the hosts were raving about Cursor, a new AI-powered coding tool.

The next day, I gave it a try.

And I'm blown away.

Cursor isn't just another AI chatbot. It's a code editor, like Sublime Text, with  a built-in AI assistant. I opened my website's project folder, asked it to tweak something, and within moments, it simply did what I asked. No endless debugging, no frustrating syntax errors. Just results.

In an hour, I made more meaningful improvements to my website—adding pagination to the blog, optimizing layouts for better readability, and fixing font inconsistencies—than I had in weeks of fiddling with ChatGPT.

It's not that ChatGPT was bad. It was great. But Cursor is different. It doesn't just suggest changes—it implements them. It moves beyond conversation and into execution. It doesn't just help you by suggesting what to do, it actually does it for you.

This feels like a really big shift. Cursor doesn't just make coding easier, but it makes building things possible for people who are no developers at all. And perhaps this will be the future of creating anything? Just write what you need, and something is built, written, designed, calculated, curated, or edited as you want it.
