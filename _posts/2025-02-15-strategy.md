I first heard about *Good Strategy, Bad Strategy* in Tom Critchlow's **SEO MBA** course, where he introduced the concept of the **“kernel”**—the foundation of a good strategy. It consists of three elements:  

- **A diagnosis** of the situation  
- **A guiding policy**  
- **A set of coherent actions**  

I found it interesting, but I didn’t immediately feel the pull to read the book.  

Then, toward the end of 2024, I listened to Richard Rumelt’s interview on *Lenny Rachitsky's Podcast*, and that conversation finally convinced me to buy it. (And yes, I sometimes fall into the trap of thinking that if I’ve heard a couple of podcast interviews with an author, I don’t need to read the book. Am I the only one guilty of this? 😅 I’m glad I didn’t make that mistake here.)  

Now that I’ve finished it, I can confidently say this book is a **wealth of knowledge and inspiration**. My eReader is full of highlights, and I’ve made countless notes. Here are just a few key takeaways:  

## 1. Strategy as design  
Simply choosing a direction isn’t enough. A strategist’s job is to arrange all the moving parts into the best possible configuration.  

## 2. Good strategy anticipates behavior  
Strategy isn’t just about setting goals—it’s about **anticipating how the market, competitors, and other forces will respond** to your moves.  

## 3. A strategy is a hypothesis  
The only real way to validate a strategy is to **execute and observe** what happens—just like in scientific research. Assumptions need to be tested, not just written down in a PowerPoint deck.  

## 4. Don’t stop at the first solution  
When tackling complex problems, it’s tempting to settle for the first viable answer. Instead, **challenge your assumptions—better alternatives may be waiting.**  

Rumelt brings these ideas to life with fascinating case studies, including **Nvidia and Starbucks**, making the book both practical and engaging.  

If you’re looking to sharpen your **strategic thinking**, I highly recommend this book. And if you’ve read it—what were your biggest takeaways?
