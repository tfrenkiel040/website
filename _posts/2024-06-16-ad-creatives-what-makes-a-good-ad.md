In this post, I explore what makes a good ad, drawing insights from Jenni Romaniuk, a notable figure from the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute.

### Grab Attention
Your ad should capture the audience's attention. No attention, means no impact.

### Brand Clarity
It's crucial that your audience can identify the brand behind the message. "Otherwise it's not an ad," Jenni remarks.

### Deliver Value
Ensure the ad is valuable or useful in a way to build memory structure, associating your brand positively.
