While this is not a question with a short and simple answer, I like the ideas shared by Jenni Romaniuk in a recent podcast.

On the '[Anstice Acast](https://www.anstice.ca/post/a-cast-episode-29-memory-marketing-myths-category-entry-points-and-distinctive-assets-with-jenni-romaniuk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"},' Jenni Romaniuk from the [Ehrenberg-Bass Institute](https://marketingscience.info/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} shared what she sees as the three critical features of good ad creatives:

### Grab Attention
Your ad should capture the audience's attention. No attention, means no impact.

### Brand Clarity
It's crucial that your audience can identify the brand behind the message. "Otherwise it's not an ad," Jenni remarks.

### Deliver Value
Ensure the ad is valuable or useful in a way to build memory structure, associating your brand positively.

She also shares a tip specifically for new brands, or brands that enter a new market: 
Signal your product category clearly. An ad can be attention-grabbing and branded perfectly, but if the audience is left guessing about what you're actually selling, it might still miss the mark.

I thought this was a great podcast episode. I also want to buy her books (How Brands Grow part 2 and Better Brand Health), but I still havent finished Eat Your Greens, by Riemer Snijders and How Brands Grow, by Byron Sharp. So will have to read those first. 


PS. The creatives above are from a campaign that ran a while ago in Sweden. I really loved this campaign and I think they are a great example of creatives that check all the boxes. By Ã…kestam Holst / NoA for Pressbyran, to promote their cinnamon buns during cinnamon bun day. (Yes, that is a day we have in Sweden.)
