At Funnel, we're actively exploring AI in two key areas: 
1. Using AI to improve our daily work; 
2. Integrating AI capabilities into our product. 

We also regularly organize knowledge sharing sessions. While these are typically led by our AI Product Director, I recently had the opportunity to present about the implications of AI and LLMs for search. Below, you'll find both the slides from that presentation and a text version of what I covered. Feel free to either go through the slides or read the full article below.

## From blue links to answers

Search has always been about one thing: helping people find the best answer. But for years, that meant ten blue links. Google would tell you where you can find the answer you were looking for, rather than just giving you the answer. Now, increasingly, it means no links at all.

AI-powered features like Google's AI Overviews (previously SGE), AI Mode, and search in ChatGPT are moving us into an era where answers are synthesized directly in the search interface. The result is a massive rise in zero-click searches. People get what they need without visiting a website.

This isn’t completely new though. Google already had an increasing number of queries for which they simply showed the answer, like "How old is Barack Obama", or "Movies with Gary Oldman". 
And the idea of keeping users on your own platform, rather then letting them go to anther website isnt new either. Other platforms have done this for years. Facebook deprioritized external links around 2015, and LinkedIn posts with external links tend to get less reach. 

Even OpenAI is now doing the same. Their Shopify integration lets you browse and buy products without ever leaving ChatGPT. 

## Google's dilemma

There is one difference though. For Google, clicks (on ads) mean revenue. But as more and more people get used to a chat-like experience instead of traditional search experience, this may also mean less clicks on ads. 

AI Overviews are already live. AI Mode is rolling out. In this mode, the regular search results disappear. They’re replaced by a fully AI-generated answer.

What’s happening under the hood is called “Query Fan-Out.” Google fires off dozens or even hundreds of background searches to synthesize the best answer.

This raises a lot of questions. What happens to SEO? What happens to paid search? What if an AI agent sees your ad — but doesn’t click?

## Not all search is equal

Different types of search will be impacted differently:

- **Informational** (“How does marketing mix modeling work?”)  
  Rapidly shifting to AI answers.
- **Navigational** (“Spotify login”)  
  Likely stays in traditional search.
- **Transactional/Local** (“Toyota garage near me”)  
  Still well-served by maps and Google’s infra.
- **Commercial Research** (“Best marketing analytics tools for agencies”)  
  In flux — tools like ChatGPT are gaining traction.

The biggest shifts are happening where nuance and synthesis matter. That’s where AI shines.

## What might happen next?

We don’t have all the answers. But there are big questions to explore:

- What happens to keyword data in Google Search Console when AI does the searching?
- How should content be structured for retrieval-augmented generation?
- How do we measure visibility when answers don’t link back to us?
- Should we track branded mentions and citations more closely?

One thing is clear: the definition of “search visibility” is changing.
