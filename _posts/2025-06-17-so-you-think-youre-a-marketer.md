This is a great opinion piece by Mats Georgson, Ph.D. on Marketing Week: [https://www.marketingweek.com/think-marketer-prove-it/](https://www.marketingweek.com/think-marketer-prove-it/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

There's a whole generation of marketers, and I'm one of them, raised as "digital marketers."

The first problem is the one Mark Ritson has pointed out many times: it's not smart to have a separate department for "digital." This creates silos that only confuse consumers, who don't think in terms of digital vs traditional.

The second problem is what Mats highlights in the article. Many of us don't fully understand the scope of marketing. Sure, we're experts in SEO, social, content, or email. But that's all Promotion. What about the other P's?

If you're a smart marketer, it's time to start thinking about Price, Place, and Product.

And I would add: also about market research, segmentation, targeting, and positioning.
