Marketers love to talk about demand generation, but do we really understand it? It seems some people think of it as creating something out of nothing, but that’s not how it works. Demand generation isn’t about inventing desire for something nobody wants. Instead, it’s about harnessing existing demand and guiding it toward your brand.

Professor Mark Ritson put it plainly: demand generation is the performance marketer’s term for “brand building.” It’s not about selling a product or a category—it’s about becoming the brand of choice in a competitive landscape. Think of it as redirecting a flowing river, not summoning rain.

A good example of successful demand generation can be found in Richard Rumelt’s *Good Strategy, Bad Strategy*. The book examines POM Wonderful’s success in the pomegranate drink business. POM didn’t create the global desire for health and wellness—that demand already existed. Instead, they built a powerful brand through product development, strategic PR, and advertising. In this way they succeeded at positioning themselves as the quintessential choice for health-conscious consumers.

Contrast this with Apple’s Vision Pro, a technological marvel priced at $3,500. Despite Apple’s exceptional branding and advertising, the headset struggled to find buyers because the market demand simply wasn’t there—especially at that price. According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-sharply-cuts-back-vision-pro-production-information-reports-2024-10-23/), Apple has significantly scaled back production and may discontinue the current version due to waning sales and stiff competition from more affordable alternatives like Meta’s Quest 3.

The lesson here? True demand generation isn’t about shouting louder; it’s about listening smarter. Understand the desires already in play. Then, position your brand as the best answer to those desires. When a market exists, demand generation can help you win. But without a market, even the best efforts may fall short.
