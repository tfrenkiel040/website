<div class="mw7 center ph3 f4 lh-copy">
  <h2>Want to get in touch?</h2>

  <p>I'm always happy to meet for coffee if you're in Stockholm, or jump on a Google Meet call to chat about projects, ideas, or just to connect. I love meeting new people and hearing about what you're working on!</p>
  
  <p>The best way to reach me is through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasfrenkiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> - feel free to send me a message there.</p>
  
  <p>If you prefer email, you can reach me at: <span class="email-protection">tfrenk<span style="display:none">no-spam</span>iel@gm<span style="display:none">hunter2</span>ail.com</span></p>

  <p class="f5 i mt4">I try to respond to all messages within a few days, but sometimes life gets busy. If you don't hear back from me, feel free to send a gentle reminder!</p>
