# Blog Post Conventions

## Introduction

This rule defines the standard format and style for blog posts on this website. Following these guidelines ensures consistency across all posts and makes content easier to read and maintain.

## File Structure and Naming

- Blog posts should be stored in the `_posts` directory
- Filenames must follow the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-with-hyphens.md`
- Example: `2025-04-17-cat-food-calculator.md`
- Always include the correct publish date in the filename
- If you're unsure of today's date, ask before creating a new post

## Frontmatter Requirements

Every blog post must begin with the following frontmatter:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Title of the post in sentence case"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [Primary Category, Optional Secondary]
---
```

- The `layout` should always be set to `post`
- The `title` should use sentence case (capitalize first word only, and proper nouns only)
- The `date` should match the date in the filename
- Include at least one relevant category. Use no more than two categories

## Content Formatting

### Headings

- The title in the frontmatter will automatically render as an H1 heading
- **Do not** add an additional H1 heading at the beginning of the post content
- Use H2 (`##`) for main sections of your post
- Use H3 (`###`) for subsections when needed
- Maintain a logical heading hierarchy (don't skip levels)

### Paragraphs and Emphasis

- Keep paragraphs relatively short for better readability
- **Limit the use of bold/strong emphasis**
  - Use bold/strong (`**text**`) for only 1-2 key points per post
  - Do not use bold in every paragraph
  - Reserve bold for truly important information

### Lists

- Use unordered lists (bullet points) for items without specific sequence
- Use ordered lists (numbers) for sequential steps or ranked items
- Keep list items concise and parallel in structure

### Links

- Use standard Markdown link format: `[Link text](mdc:URL)`
- For internal links, use relative paths: `[Link text](mdc:path/to/page)`
- Example: `[Cat Food Calculator](mdc:catfood-calculator-v2)`
- For external links, add attributes to open in a new tab: `[Link text](https://example.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}`
  - This ensures external links don't navigate users away from your site
  - The `rel` attribute improves security and privacy

### Images

- Images should be stored in the `/assets/images/` directory
- Use standard Markdown image syntax with alt text: `![Alt text](mdc:assets/images/image.jpg)`
- Consider adding a caption for complex images

## Content Style

- Write in a clear, conversational tone
- Use sentence case for all headings (not title case)
- Keep sentences and paragraphs concise
- When discussing complext topics, use example to make it easier for readers to understand
- Use contractions where appropriate to maintain a friendly tone
- Include a brief introduction that summarizes what the post is about

## Examples

Here's an example of a well-structured blog post:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "How I built a cat food calculator"
date: 2025-04-17
categories: [Projects]
---

A few weeks ago, I launched a web app that calculates how much food your adult cat needs per day. It's based on scientifically accepted nutrition formulas, and helps owners get accurate feeding recommendations.

## What it does

The calculator helps cat owners determine:

- Daily caloric needs based on weight and activity level
- Recommended portion sizes for different food types
- Adjustments for special conditions

## How I built it

I used a combination of vanilla JavaScript and Jekyll for hosting. The most challenging part was developing the formula to account for both wet and dry food combinations.

## What's next

I plan to add a food database and potentially create a mobile app version in the future.
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Adding an H1 heading at the beginning of the post (redundant with the title)
- Overusing bold/strong emphasis throughout the post
- Using title case instead of sentence case for post titles
- Including the wrong date in the frontmatter or filename
- Writing overly long paragraphs without breaks
