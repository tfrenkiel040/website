<h2> Marketer & SEO Strategist at Funnel</h2>
        

<p>I'm Thomas, based in Stockholm, Sweden, specializing in SEO, web product management, and B2B marketing. At Funnel, my role intersects these areas as I focus on enhancing our online presence and driving growth.</p>

<p>My career started at smaller agencies in the Netherlands, after which I worked at Havas Media and Orangedotcom in Amsterdam. I led the SEO team at Orangedotcom when we were acquired by iO. During my time agency-side, I developed and executed impactful SEO strategies for a diverse range of clients.</p>

<p>At Funnel, I go beyond traditional SEO. I work closely with cross-functional teams to bring marketing and product ideas to life on our website, ensuring that our digital strategies align with broader business goals. My approach is deeply data-driven and collaborative, aiming to create a web environment that not only ranks well but also delivers on user expectations and business objectives.</p>

<p>I am passionate about mentoring and empowering others, and I strive to lead by example in fostering an inclusive and innovative workplace. I believe that sharing knowledge and working together can lead to extraordinary results.</p>
