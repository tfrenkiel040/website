<h2> Growth PM at Funnel</h2>
        

<p>I'm Thomas, a Growth PM at Funnel.</p>

<p>I'm responsible for our marketing website, managing it as a product and combining product thinking with marketing insights to drive acquisition.</p>

<p>My career began in the Netherlands, working at smaller agencies and Havas Media before joining Orangedotcom. I was serving as Head of SEO at Orangedotcom when the agency was acquired by iO Digital.</p>

<p>Later, I moved to Funnel to build their SEO presence from the ground up. After successfully scaling that channel, I transitioned into a Product Management role. Today, I own the website roadmap, manage stakeholder alignment, and ensure that everything we ship delivers measurable impact.</p>

<p>As a leader, I focus on leading by example. My goal is to build environments where cross-functional teams can thrive. Great work isn't solo work; it happens when we stay curious and solve problems together. I've learned that people need trust to share their thoughts, and some need time as well. I always strive to include everyone, even those who aren't inclined to speak up right away.</p>

<p>Outside of work I like to spend time with my daughter, go for a run, brew a good pour over, or do some vibe-coding.</p>

<p>Let's chat. Reach out via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasfrenkiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
