# Senior Digital Marketer & SEO Strategist at Funnel

Welcome to my personal website! I'm Thomas, based in Stockholm, Sweden, specializing in SEO, web product management, and B2B marketing. At Funnel, my role intersects these areas as I focus on enhancing our web presence and driving organic growth through strategic SEO initiatives and collaborative product management.

With over ten years in the digital marketing field, I have honed my skills across various capacities, from SEO specialist to web project leader. My career has spanned multiple leading agencies like Havas Media and iO, where I developed and executed impactful SEO strategies for a diverse range of clients including major corporations and small businesses alike.

At Funnel, I go beyond traditional SEO. I work closely with cross-functional teams to bring marketing and product ideas to life on our website, ensuring that our digital strategies align seamlessly with broader business goals. My approach is deeply data-driven and collaborative, aiming to create a web environment that not only ranks well but also delivers on user expectations and business objectives.

I am passionate about mentoring and empowering others, and I strive to lead by example in fostering an inclusive and innovative workplace. I believe that sharing knowledge and working together can lead to extraordinary results, and I regularly contribute to industry events to discuss the latest in SEO and digital marketing trends.
